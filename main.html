            <h1>About Group</h1>
            <p>Rammstein  is a German Neue Deutsche Härte band formed in Berlin in 1994. Their six-man lineup—lead vocalist Till Lindemann, lead guitarist Richard Z. Kruspe, rhythm guitarist Paul Landers, bassist Oliver Riedel, drummer Christoph Schneider, and keyboardist Christian "Flake" Lorenz—has remained unchanged throughout their existence. Prior to their formation, some members were associated with acts such as Feeling B and First Arsch.</p>
            <p>Following the expansive tour, Rammstein signed with major label Universal Music and released Mutter in 2001. Six singles were released from the album, all charting in multiple countries throughout Europe. The lead single, "Sonne", reached No. 2 in Germany. They released Reise, Reise in 2004 and had two more singles reach No. 2 in Germany; "Mein Teil" and "Amerika". The following year saw the release of their fifth album, Rosenrot, and a live release, Völkerball, one year after.</p>
            <p>Rammstein were one of the first Neue Deutsche Härte bands; their Herzeleid album led the music press to coin that term. Their style of music has generally had a positive reception from music critics. Commercially, the band have been very successful, earning many No. 1 albums as well as gold and platinum certifications in countries around the world. Their grand live performances, which often feature pyrotechnics, have played a part in their popularity growth. Despite success, the band have been subject to some controversies, with their overall image having been subject to criticism - for instance, the uncensored music video for "Pussy" was interspersed with scenes of hardcore pornography and the song "Ich tu dir weh" forced Liebe ist für alle da to be re-released in Germany with the song removed from the album due to its graphic lyrics about sex.</p>

            <h1>Best Album</h1>
            <h3>Mutter (2000–2002)</h3>
            <p>Rammstein's album Mutter was recorded in the south of France in May and June 2000, and mixed in Stockholm in October of that year. During December 2000, Rammstein released an MP3 version of "Links 2-3-4" as a teaser for their new album.</p>
            <p>2001 was a busy year for Rammstein, as the band needed to finish off the Sehnsucht Tour ending in January and February with the band playing the Big Day Out festival in Australia and New Zealand and playing some concerts in Japan. January also heralded the shooting of the video for their upcoming single, "Sonne", recorded in Potsdam at Babelsberger Filmstudios from 13 to 15 January 2001. The video was released on 29 January 2001. The single for "Sonne" was released on 12 February 2001 in Europe, featuring an instrumental version of the song, two remixes by Clawfinger and the song "Adios" from the upcoming album.</p>
            <p>Mutter was released on 2 April 2001, sparking another Rammstein tour through Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. On 14 May, the second single from the album, "Links 2 3 4", was released, along with a video of the single on 18 May. After a tour throughout Europe in June, the band then toured the U.S., Canada and Mexico from June to August 2001. "Ich will", the third single from the album, was released on 10 September 2001 and a Tour edition of the Mutter album (the cover of which is red)[8] was released, featuring alternative artwork and live versions of "Ich will", "Links 2 3 4", "Sonne" and "Spieluhr".</p>
            <p>From 8 to 12 January 2002, Rammstein traveled to Prague to participate in a minor scene for the film XXX.

Rammstein released two remixes of the song. Furthermore, the single's track listing included "Du hast" and "Bück dich" cover versions by Battery.
